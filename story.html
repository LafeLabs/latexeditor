<h1>Story of the Crystal City Metamap Instance</h1>

<h2>What is the "Metamap"?</h2>
<p>
    The Metamap is a system for building maps. It is not a map, not a company, not a software package or a website. It is a set of conventions which are intended to be used in both analog and digital realms for creating maps as social media in the physical world.

<h2>Why the Metamap?</h2>




<h2>Why Crystal City?</h2>

<p>Crystal City is fantastic!  When I first moved here I could hardly believe this place is real.  Giant chess boards?  Hanging net chairs in the park where you can see the freight trains go by and there is coffee in the park?  And giant tunnels connecting everything...it just seemed like a weird futuristic fantasy of what urban life might be like.  Crystal city feels very physical and very human.  It has a extremely high density of urban development and yet somehow manages to have an amazing array of very open green spaces designed for just hanging around</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, in the quest to build social media based on the physical world and not centralized servers, Crystal City is a very interesting test case because of the broad and deep range of talent that works here every day and hence hangs around the public spaces getting lunch and coffee.  We have art, aerospace, IT, public television, every kind of federal contractor, lots of public employees, food service, general infrastructure, transportation...a vast array of skilled professionals call this place home both during the work day/week and at night in the high density high rise housing.  And we also have a rich diversity of local communities around here of all kinds, from all points of the globe as well as with deep local roots in Virginia. What this means for the designer of social networks is that we can probably draw a circle with a radius of only a few hundred yards around the center of Crystal City, make a network that is only targeted to that area, and end up with something potentially as interesting as any Google or Facebook, but with local control and much better signal to noise ratio.

<h2>Who Made this?</h2>
<p>
    Hopefully, soon, the answer will be you, and you'll replace this section with yourself, and your own motivations in working on the project.  This initial instance of the Crystal City Metamap was built by Lafe Spietz, an applied physicist who lives and works here in crystal city, doing random consulting for the quantum information field.  This work is, however, way outside the scope of any sort of professional physics research.

<h2>How to Participate and Expand</h2>

<p>In short, participation is replication!  In my view the only way to build a truly decentralized social network is to eliminate the user/developer dichotomy completely, and have every participant actively create new content of every kind--not just text and images, but actual structure content which you can extend to other areas in the world without asking anyone for permission(everything here is released into the Public Domain with no restrictions whatsoever).</p>
