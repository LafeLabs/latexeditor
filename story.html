<h1>Story of the Crystal City Metamap Instance</h1>

<h2>What is the "Metamap"?</h2>
<p>
    The Metamap is a system for building maps. It is not a map, not a company, not a software package or a website. It is a set of conventions which are intended to be used in both analog and digital realms for creating maps as social media in the physical world.  While the prefix "meta" comes from a misreading of Aristotle, it has come to mean a thing of one level more abstraction than the thing to which it refers, and I'm using it in the same sense as "metalanguage" or "metamathematics", which are the language used to describe a language and the math used to describe math. This is a map you use as a guide to making maps.  
</p>
<p>
    The Metamap is also a generalization of what computer programmers call "Object Oriented Programming", where a general object of information is constructed, which is then "instanced" by constructing individual examples of that class of objects. 
</p>

<h2>Why the Metamap?</h2>

<p>
The Internet has effectively destroyed distance.  This is liberating in many ways, enabling people to work and share their lives with people all over the world.  But it has also gone a long way to destroying <em>place</em>, and I think this is one reason the rise of the Internet has led to such massive disparities in wealth and power.  A totally centralized network where a small group of billionaires in San Francisco control everything has no need for any one place to be tolerable or functional.  If the economy of a small town is totally destroyed by the shifting winds of global capital, the economy will just shift and replace it with another in another place, chasing low wages on one side and high income spenders on the other side.   
</p>
<p>
    The Metamap is an attempt to bring place back, while leveraging the power of the distance-destroying technologies of Internet-enabled media devices. Software engineers will say that this is just a "a geolocation API", but that's just technology, and my goal here is to create something more akin to culture than technology.  Also, I want this system to more reflect the psychogeography of a place, with numbers only used as needed by the human <em>mind</em> while your physical body is actually in a place.   
</p>
<p>
    I believe that we can use the tools of networked information to build map structures that enable us to communicate value in a much more complex way than the current system involving monetary transactions.  When I walk up to a coffee shop and pay money for coffee, this transaction is just a point in space and time with a single number.  How I got that money doesn't matter, where I had coffee yesterday doesn't matter, and what happens to it afterward doesn't matter, nor does it really matter which coffee shop I go to.  Having a layer of information which is carried on physical cards which have geographic information on them and which flow around through a area in a complex way creates exponentially more complexity then monetary transactions.  This transition in complexity is similar to that of the transition from classical computing to quantum computing.

<h2>Why Crystal City?</h2>

<p>Crystal City is fantastic!  When I first moved here I could hardly believe this place is real.  Giant chess boards?  Hanging net chairs in the park where you can see the freight trains go by and there is coffee in the park?  And giant tunnels connecting everything...it just seemed like a weird futuristic fantasy of what urban life might be like.  Crystal city feels very physical and very human.  It has a extremely high density of urban development and yet somehow manages to have an amazing array of very open green spaces designed for just hanging around</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, in the quest to build social media based on the physical world and not centralized servers, Crystal City is a very interesting test case because of the broad and deep range of talent that works here every day and hence hangs around the public spaces getting lunch and coffee.  We have art, aerospace, IT, public television, every kind of federal contractor, lots of public employees, food service, general infrastructure, transportation...a vast array of skilled professionals call this place home both during the work day/week and at night in the high density high rise housing.  And we also have a rich diversity of local communities around here of all kinds, from all points of the globe as well as with deep local roots in Virginia. What this means for the designer of social networks is that we can probably draw a circle with a radius of only a few hundred yards around the center of Crystal City, make a network that is only targeted to that area, and end up with something potentially as interesting as any Google or Facebook, but with local control and much better signal to noise ratio.

<h2>Who Made this?</h2>
<p>
    Hopefully, soon, the answer will be you, and you'll replace this section with yourself, and your own motivations in working on the project.  This initial instance of the Crystal City Metamap was built by Lafe Spietz, an applied physicist who lives and works here in crystal city, doing random consulting for the quantum information field.  This work is, however, way outside the scope of any sort of professional physics research.

<p>
    Please, if you get this map here in Crystal City, reach out to me via email at lafelabs[at]gmail.com or using text(no calls) at (303)817-8283, or connect via <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/lafe-spietz-454926125">LinkedIn</a> or via Instagram at @lafelabs, and I will show you in person how to replicate all these parts, as well as how to replicate the replication: how to teach others what I'm teaching you.  This is free!  Really free!  If you're part of a large well funded organization and want me to do consulting work we can talk about rates for that but if you're representing only yourself as an individual this is all free.

    Just to be clear, I'm not a software engineer or developer, this is not a startup company I have no employees or investors.  This is not a website or "dotcom" of any kind.  I'm not trying to sell you anything. I created this from scratch using art supplies, html, css, javascript and php in order to make the world directly around me more tolerable to live in.

<h2>How to Participate and Expand</h2>

<p>In short, participation is replication!  In my view the only way to build a truly decentralized social network is to eliminate the user/developer dichotomy completely, and have every participant actively create new content of every kind--not just text and images, but actual structure content which you can extend to other areas in the world without asking anyone for permission(everything here is released into the Public Domain with no restrictions whatsoever).</p>
